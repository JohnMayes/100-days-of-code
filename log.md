### Day 1: Feb. 20, Teusday

**Today's Progress**: Just starting. I completed the first 15 or so challenges at FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** I am pretty much new to coding. However, I did do some HTML back in the late 90's as a hobby, so I at least know basically what is going on with the front end development challenges so far. CSS is completely new to me. I learned on my own how to use multiple CSS classes in a single element, which felt good.

**Link(s) to work** I will put something here when I have built something or, in the case of FreeCodeCamp, have completed a challenge I feel particularly proud of.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
