### Day 1: Feb. 20, Teusday

**Today's Progress**: Just starting. I completed the first 15 or so challenges at FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** I am pretty much new to coding. However, I did do some HTML back in the late 90's as a hobby, so I at least know basically what is going on with the front end development challenges so far. CSS is completely new to me. I learned on my own how to use multiple CSS classes in a single element, which felt good.

**Link(s) to work** I will put something here when I have built something or, in the case of FreeCodeCamp, have completed a challenge I feel particularly proud of.

### Day 2: Feb. 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More FreeCodeCamp. Slowly building "Free Cat Photo App."

**Thoughts** I am liking what one can do with CSS so far.

### Day 3: Feb. 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More FreeCodeCamp. Learned how to create forms and use ids. Learned a little bit about how HTML works regarding the formatting of a webpage.

**Thoughts** FreeCodeCamp's tutorials are good, and I am learning just by doing, but I think I would like to understand more the "grammar and syntax" of the code, i.e. the "why" of what I am doing, if that makes sense. So I will look into that.

### Day 4: Feb. 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learned some more CSS 

**Thoughts** Finished the very first section of FreeCodeCamp. Looking forward to seeing what Bootstrap is all about.

### Day 4: Feb. 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Watched an online tutorial, Reviewed HTML and started building a repository of HTML elements

**Thoughts** I decided to take a break from FreeCodeCamp and spend Saturday reviewing from another source what I have learned. Perhaps I will make doing so a weekly habit.

##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
