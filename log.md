### Day 1: Feb. 20, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Just starting. I completed the first 15 or so challenges at FreeCodeCamp. 

**Thoughts** I am pretty much new to coding. However, I did do some HTML back in the late 90's as a hobby, so I at least know basically what is going on with the front end development challenges so far. CSS is completely new to me. I learned on my own how to use multiple CSS classes in a single element, which felt good.

**Link(s) to work** I will put something here when I have built something or, in the case of FreeCodeCamp, have completed a challenge I feel particularly proud of.

### Day 2: Feb. 21, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: More FreeCodeCamp. Slowly building "Free Cat Photo App."

**Thoughts** I am liking what one can do with CSS so far.

### Day 3: Feb. 22, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: More FreeCodeCamp. Learned how to create forms and use ids. Learned a little bit about how HTML works regarding the formatting of a webpage.

**Thoughts** FreeCodeCamp's tutorials are good, and I am learning just by doing, but I think I would like to understand more the "grammar and syntax" of the code, i.e. the "why" of what I am doing, if that makes sense. So I will look into that.

### Day 4: Feb. 23, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Learned some more CSS 

**Thoughts** Finished the very first section of FreeCodeCamp. Looking forward to seeing what Bootstrap is all about.

### Day 5: Feb. 24, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Watched an online tutorial, Reviewed HTML and started building a repository of HTML elements

**Thoughts** I decided to take a break from FreeCodeCamp and spend Saturday reviewing from another source what I have learned. Perhaps I will make doing so a weekly habit.

### Day 6: Feb. 26, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More FreeCodeCamp. Began learning Bootstrap.

**Thoughts** Bootstratp seems pretty useful. At this rate I may be able to start my basic front end development projects by friday.

### Day 7: Feb. 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Bootstrap tutorial, although I am sure there is still plenty to learn. Began some basic jQuery.

**Thoughts** What I have seen so far of jQuery makes me want to jump right in and start learning JavaScript.

### Day 8: Feb. 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the jQuery tutorials and set up my codepen.io account.

**Thoughts** Still looking forward to learning JavaScript. I should put some thought into my first front end development projects; I want them to look nice. 

### Day 9: Mar. 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Worked through some CSS review.

**Thoughts** There is a lot to learn in CSS. 

### Day 10: Mar. 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More CSS review. Started a rough layout of my first webpage.

**Thoughts** It's late! 

### Day 11: Mar. 3, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Built HTML framework. Content is in place. Decided on the layout and style I am going to use. Did some preliminary CSS.

**Thoughts** Codepen does not let you create multiple HTML files within one webpage, so I am going to try to use jQuery to add a simple multi-page layout to my page.

### Day 12: Mar. 5, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Finalized CSS. Wrestling with jQuery.

**Thoughts** I figured out how to hide content within a page using jQuery, but I am having trouble with subsequently displaying only certain content afterwards. I can think of one possible solution, but that would involve re-writing my HTML and I would rather not do that if I donâ€™t have too. 

### Day 13: Mar. 6, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I finished my first front end development challenge!

**Thoughts** I had to search online for examples of what I was trying to do with jQuery. I found one, and it helped me to learn a little more about how jQuery works.

### Day 14: Mar. 7, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Began work on the second front end challenge. Created a responsive navbar with different styling for desktop and mobile.

**Thoughts** Bootstrap seems like a pretty useful toolset. We will see if it can do everything I ask it to.

### Day 15: Mar. 8, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Banged my head up against a wall trying to get some particular elements in my navbar to working how I wished, until I finally figured out it was because of some specific behavior of boostrap nav-items.

**Thoughts** Bootstrap is handy but definitely has its limitations. It makes structuring a website more simple and straightforward, but if there is something specific I want to do, I still have to use CSS.

### Day 16: Mar. 9, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Got the navbar working exactly as I wished using jQuery. Learned some in the process.

**Thoughts** Solving problems feels good.

### Day 17: Mar. 15, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Added content and played with the layout of my portfolio page.

**Thoughts** Slowly learning how to make bootstrap do what I want it to.

### Day 18: Mar. 16, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Testing a new nevbar system, again with jQurey. Using flexbox this time. Took awhile to get it working how I wished.

**Thoughts** Flexbox seems like it might be slightly more economical than Bootstrap, code-wise. Not half as many divs and containers.

### Day 19: Mar. 29, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented new navbar.

**Thoughts** Making something look good on both desktop and mobile is kind of tricky.

### Day 20: Mar. 30, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Added a "contact me" form.

**Thoughts** Just plugging away. Hope to finish the portfolio page soon.
